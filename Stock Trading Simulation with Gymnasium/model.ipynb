    "Your project is centered around developing a reinforcement learning (RL) simulation for stock trading in Python. This initiative is spearheaded by Quantum Trading, a fictional but ambitious trading firm looking to leverage cutting-edge machine learning techniques to gain a competitive edge in the financial markets. Quantum Trading is a small but highly specialised team of financial analysts, data scientists, and software engineers who are passionate about transforming the way trading decisions are made.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the fast-paced world of financial markets, staying ahead of the curve is crucial. Traditional trading strategies, while effective, often rely on historical data and predefined rules that may not adapt quickly to changing market conditions. Reinforcement learning, a subfield of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment, offers a promising alternative. It allows the trading algorithms to learn and adapt in real-time, improving their performance as they gain more experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "By engaging with this project, you will gain valuable insights into the dynamic world of algorithmic trading and enhance your skill set in data science, finance, and machine learning. Remember, the journey of learning and experimentation is as important as the results. Good luck, and may your trading algorithms be ever profitable!\n",

However, it is very hard to not be profitable given the extreme increase in the price of AAPL over the 15 years of data provided. You would have made significantly more by simply spending all of the initial balance on shares at the starting date, holding the shares, and selling at the ending date. You likely would have made significantly more over that time period by investing your initial balance in any number of asset classes.\n- Why do you think it has performed the way it has?\nEvery transaction that this model makes is the same size. That is why your balance history will have a lot of spikes and drops, as the model buys with 10% of its balance and then sells again instantly with 10% of its balance, making either a small profit or loss. An improvement that could be made here is calculating the position size based on the confidence the model has in its decision, taking a smaller position if less confident and a larger position if more confident. This model also does not account for any transaction costs or slippage which would be a key factor in a real trading scenario.\n- How could the data we have selected impact the performance of the model?\nThis model uses 15 years of data which is a long time. It is very hard to not make money given a stock that has gone from around $4 to over $200! An interesting experiment would be to select some stock data for a company that has not seen the same extreme growth that Apple has seen and observe how the model performs.\n\"\"\"",

    "Questions/Answers\n",
    "- What do you think about the performance of this model?\n",
    "The model has technically been profitable in that the cash balance is higher than what it started with. However, it is very hard to not be profitable given the extreme increase in the price of AAPL over the 15 years of data provided. You would have made significantly more by simply spending all of the initial balance on shares at the starting date, holding the shares, and selling at the ending date. You likely would have made significantly more over that time period by investing your initial balance in any number of asset classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Why do you think it has performed the way it has?\n",
    "Every transaction that this model makes is the same size. That is why your balance history will have a lot of spikes and drops, as the model buys with 10% of its balance and then sells again instantly with 10% of its balance, making either a small profit or loss. An improvement that could be made here is calculating the position size based on the confidence the model has in its decision, taking a smaller position if less confident and a larger position if more confident. This model also does not account for any transaction costs or slippage which would be a key factor in a real trading scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "- How could the data we have selected impact the performance of the model?\n",
    "This model uses 15 years of data which is a long time. It is very hard to not make money given a stock that has gone from around $4 to over $200! An interesting experiment would be to select some stock data for a company that has not seen the same extreme growth that Apple has seen and observe how the model performs."
