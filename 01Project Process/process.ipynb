    "## A detailed step-by-step guide on how I build data projects\n",
    "\n",
    "A breakdown of my project-building into two main types, each with its own five-step process: **Reporting Projects** and **Coding Projects**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Type 1: The Reporting Project**\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of project is ideal for roles like **Data Analyst (DA)** and **Data Scientist (DS)**. The primary goal is to demonstrate your ability to extract meaningful insights from data and communicate them effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5 Steps to Create a Reporting Project:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use **\"Predicting the Stock Market\"** project as an example to walk through these steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Create a Hypothesis**\n",
    "*   **What it is:** Start with a clear question or a statement you want to test. This provides a clear focus for your analysis.\n",
    "*   **Example:** \"With historical stock market data, we can predict future prices. Specifically, we will try to predict the days when a stock's price will go up.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Analyze the Data to Discover Trends**\n",
    "*   **What it is:** Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA). This involves loading, cleaning, and visualizing the data to understand its structure and find initial patterns or interesting points.\n",
    "*   **Example:** Load historical Microsoft stock price data into a Jupyter Notebook, display the first few rows, and create a line chart to see how the stock price has changed over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Try to Prove (or Disprove) Your Hypothesis**\n",
    "*   **What it is:** Apply a formal method, often a statistical test or a machine learning model, to directly address your hypothesis.\n",
    "*   **Example:** Build a machine learning model to predict if the stock price will increase. The initial model in the video achieved an accuracy of 51%, which is only slightly better than a coin flip, indicating the initial hypothesis is weak but has potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4: Ask Follow-up Questions**\n",
    "*   **What it is:** A good analysis doesn't just stop at the first result. You should iterate on your work. Think about what could make your model better or what other factors might be at play.\n",
    "*   **Example:** To improve the model's accuracy, new predictors (features) like rolling weekly and quarterly price averages were engineered and added to the model. This is a follow-up action based on the initial weak result.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 5: Think of Next Steps**\n",
    "*   **What it is:** Conclude your project by documenting potential avenues for future improvement. This shows employers that you think critically and understand the limitations and potential of your work.\n",
    "*   **Example:** The project's README or final section might include ideas like:\n",
    "    *   Improving the algorithm (e.g., trying a different model, tweaking parameters).\n",
    "    *   Adding more predictors (e.g., data from other stock exchanges, news sentiment).\n",
    "    *   Improving the backtesting technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Type 2: The Coding Project**\n",
    "\n",
    "This project type is essential for roles like **Data Engineer (DE)**, **Machine Learning Engineer (MLE)**, and more technical **Data Scientist (DS)** roles. The goal is to prove you can write clean, efficient, and deployable code that can be used in a production environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5 Steps to Create a Coding Project:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The video uses a **\"Predicting Loan Defaults\"** project as an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Find a Dataset**\n",
    "*   **What it is:** Similar to the reporting project, you start by identifying a dataset you want to work with.\n",
    "*   **Example:** Using a dataset from Fannie Mae about loan performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Build a Pipeline to Transform the Data or Create Predictions**\n",
    "*   **What it is:** A pipeline is a series of automated steps applied to the data. Instead of a one-off analysis in a notebook, you are creating a repeatable, structured process. This could involve cleaning data, transforming it, and feeding it into a model to generate predictions.\n",
    "*   **Example:** Create a series of Python scripts: one to clean the data, another to assemble it, a third to make predictions, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Implement the Pipeline**\n",
    "*   **What it is:** Write the actual code in a structured way, often across multiple files. This is different from having all the code in a single notebook. Use a proper IDE (like VS Code, PyCharm) and structure your project with separate files for different functions.\n",
    "*   **Example:** The GitHub repository shown has multiple files like `predict.py`, `assemble.py`, and `settings.py`, demonstrating modular and organized code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4: Improve Performance**\n",
    "*   **What it is:** The focus here is on the technical performance of your code. This means two things:\n",
    "    1.  **Accuracy:** How good are the model's predictions?\n",
    "    2.  **Efficiency:** How fast and resource-efficient is your code?\n",
    "*   **Example:** Refactor the code to run faster or use less memory. Tune the machine learning model to improve its accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 5: Think of Next Steps**\n",
    "*   **What it is:** Just like with reporting projects, document what you would do next. This demonstrates your engineering mindset.\n",
    "*   **Example:** A `README.md` file should not only explain the project but also include clear installation and usage instructions, making it easy for someone else (like a hiring manager) to run your code. This is a critical part of a coding project."
