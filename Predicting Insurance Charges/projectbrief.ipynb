    "\n",
    "*   **Hypothesis 1 (Smoker Status): Strong Support.** The model's coefficient for `smoker_yes` was the largest and positive, clearly indicating that being a smoker is a major predictor of higher insurance charges.\n",
    "*   **Hypothesis 2 (Age): Supported.** The positive and significant coefficient for `age` confirms that insurance charges are predicted to increase with age.\n",
    "*   **Hypothesis 3 (BMI): Supported.** The positive coefficient for `bmi` shows that higher Body Mass Index is associated with higher predicted insurance costs.\n",
    "*   **Hypothesis 4 (Children): Supported.** The positive coefficient for `children` suggests a positive correlation between the number of children and predicted charges, although its impact is less significant than the top three factors.\n",
    "*   **Hypothesis 5 (Region): Partially Supported.** While the model shows that region does have some influence (indicated by the region coefficients), its impact is relatively smaller compared to smoking, age, and BMI.\n",
    "*   **Hypothesis 6 (Sex): Weakly Supported.** The coefficient for `sex_male` was very small and negative, suggesting a minimal difference in predicted charges based on sex in this model.\n",
